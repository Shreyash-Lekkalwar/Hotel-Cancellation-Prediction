# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
The provided code represents a machine learning (ML) project aimed at predicting hotel booking cancellations. Here's a summary of the ML model and its workflow:

    Problem Background and Motivation:
        The problem revolves around predicting hotel booking cancellations, which is a crucial task in the hospitality industry to manage reservations efficiently.
        The motivation is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a booking will be canceled or not.

    Brief Description of the Problem:
        The problem involves using various machine learning algorithms to classify hotel bookings as either canceled or not canceled based on different features.

    Data Preparation:
        The dataset used for this task is named "hotel_bookings.csv".
        Data preparation steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.
        Techniques such as filling missing values with default or average values and dropping columns with high missing value counts are employed.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Exploratory data analysis involves visualizing the data, checking for correlations, and understanding feature distributions.
        Heatmaps are used to visualize missing values and feature correlations.

    Feature Engineering:
        Categorical variables are one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
        Feature scaling is performed using standard scaling and min-max scaling to normalize the data.

    Model Building and Evaluation:
        Various machine learning algorithms are implemented, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
        Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices are computed for each model.
        Cross-validation is used for model evaluation to ensure robustness.

    Model Selection:
        Based on the evaluation metrics and performance, the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model is selected as the winning model.
        The decision is made considering factors such as accuracy, F1 score, false positives, false negatives, and computational time.

Overall, the workflow involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model selection to predict hotel booking cancellations effectively. The MLP model is chosen as it demonstrates the best performance based on the evaluation criteria.
